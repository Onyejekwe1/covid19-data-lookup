# covid19-data-lookup

A corona virus data look-up app built with dart and flutter.

The main purpose of this project is to build a repository architecture using dart. several APIs were consumed in the course of the project

one of which is covid19-data.p.rapidapi.com. The file containing the API keys and other private info was ommitted from the git push.


# Running the project

Running the project is quite easy, just pull, allow dart/flutter to get all the required dependencies, and run. You might encounter an error due to the missing api keys file, you can just replace the places the keys will be needed with a string, just to run the project for the first time.
